            <p class="body-text">We are a group of citizens of the Ottawa region who are concerned by the threat of
                climate
                change to our communities, our planet and our future. We believe in the vision of a Green New Deal and
                its
                potential to tackle the climate crisis and increasing inequality at the same time by reducing emissions,
                preserving biodiversity, and promoting social justice. As we transition to a renewable energy economy,
                we want
                to ensure that no one - especially those on the frontlines of the climate crisis - is left behind.</p>

            We are creating a coalition of organizations and people who support the vision for a Green New Deal and are
            advocating for change in the Ottawa region that aligns with this vision.

            With the input of the GND Coalition members and others, we plan to develop a municipal resolution and
            push
            for its adoption by the Ottawa City Council.

            Recognizing that there are already many organizations and people doing great work in the Ottawa region that
            aligns with the vision for a GND, our goal is to amplify the strengths of these organizations, support
            alliances, serve as an information hub, and build widespread support for a GND in the Ottawa region.
